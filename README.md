# Home Credit Project

## Business problem and Project Objective
Home Credit Group aims to broaden financial inclusion for unbanked populations by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. The key challenge is accurately predicting which loan applicants will be able to repay their loans. This prediction is critical because:

1. Rejecting good applicants means lost business opportunities
2. Approving high-risk applicants may lead to financial losses and increased default rates.
3. Many potential customers lack conventional credit histories, making traditional scoring methods inadequate

The company currently uses various statistical and machine learning methods to make these predictions but believes there's room for improvement. The goal, and therefore the purpose of this notebook, is to develop a model that can more accurately identify which clients are capable of repayment, allowing Home Credit to make better-informed lending decisions.

Customer repayment probability will be generated using a supervised machine-learning model. The model will use as inputs data collected on past customers such as application, demographic, and historical credit behavior. The model will use this information to predict the probability that the customers will either repay or not repay their loans. 

## My groups solution to the business problem

## My contribution to the project
My main contribution to the project was in model building. I created two types of models: Decision Tree and Random Forest. I created base models for both of them, and then adjuted those models, tuning different hyperparameters. I then analyzed each model I built in terms of the business problem, while comparing them to other models that had been built. I also was responsible for creating the final predictions for our best model and then submitting it to Kaggle to get our final score. I explained our final model performance and results, and worked on the introduction and describing our data preparation steps.

## What I learned in the project
The biggest thing I learned in this project was the importance of EDA and data preparation. I hadn't placed much importance in EDA wtih previous projects I've done, doing very little exploration before getting into the modeling stage. With this project, however, I spent a lot more time exploring the data. I created a lot of graphs looking into relationships and trying to find outliers or placeholder values. This allowed me early on to see variables that might be important when modeling as well as multiple outliers and placeholder values. That was valuable information that I would not have learned had I not taken the time to do a thourough exploration of the data. When it comes to data preparation, I learned how important it is to be thorough making sure the data is clean and ready to be modeled. A lot of work went into making sure we dealt with missing information, outliers,
